Open issues and PRs !

Contributions and pull requests are welcome, but we ask the following guidelines are respected;

    the PR adds a compelling new feature
    OR addresses a known / open issue
    OR improves reliability / robustness
    don't update version num - will be incremented when the PR is merged
